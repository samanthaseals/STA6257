### Methodological Projects

You will choose one area to work in. Note that these are likely new-to-you topics. You will first learn about the topic and demonstrate how to apply the new methodology to a real dataset. The final deliverables from the project will be a written paper and an oral presentation with slides. 

The methodologies to consider:

  - Missing data and imputation
  - Longitudinal analysis
  - Polynomial regression
  - Quantile regression
  - Cubic splines
  - LASSO and ridge regression
  - Beta regression
  - Cross validation
  - Bootstrapping and jackknife estimation
  - Kernel regression
  - K-means clustering
  - Principal component analysis
  - Generalized additive models
  - Generalized estimating equations
  - Cox proportional hazards model
  - Modeling in the Bayesian framework
  
You are free to propose a different methodology if there is something you are interested in, but is not on the list. The methodology must be approved by the instructor to ensure that it meets the expectations of a capstone project.

### Team Makeup

There will be 7 teams:

- 6 groups of three students
- 1 group of two students

    - Note that each student will take one of three roles (see below). The group with two students will borrow a CTO from another group's expertise.

All students on the team are expected to analyze the data and contribute to the writing of the paper equally. However, each student will take on a specific role:

- Chief Operating Officer

    - This team member will be responsible for communication on behalf of the team, keeping up with deadlines, and making sure team deliverables are transferred to Dr. Seals.
    
- Chief Information Officer

    - This team member will be responsible for the cohesiveness of the report. 
    
- Chief Technology Officer

    - This team member will be responsible for publishing the paper to a GitHub website in [Quarto Book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) format.
