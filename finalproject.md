### Methodological Projects

You will choose one area to work in. Note that these are likely new-to-you topics. You will first learn about the topic and demonstrate how to apply the new methodology to a real dataset. The final deliverables from the project will be a written paper and an oral presentation with slides. 

The methodologies to consider:

  - Missing data and imputation
  - Longitudinal analysis
  - Polynomial regression
  - Quantile regression
  - Cubic splines
  - LASSO and ridge regression
  - Cross validation
  - Bootstrapping and jackknife estimation
  - Kernel regression
  - K-means clustering
  - Principal component analysis
  - Generalized additive models
  - Generalized estimating equations
  - ~~Cox proportional hazards model~~ EA, CE, ER
  
You are free to propose a different methodology if there is something you are interested in, but is not on the list. The methodology must be approved by the instructor to ensure that it meets the expectations of a capstone project.

#### Week of October 17 (Week 9)

This week, you will be performing individual research, reading about the specific topic for your final project. Your group's final literature review will include at least 5 peer-reviewed sources (i.e., textbooks or journal articles). You should find resources that help you understand the methodological topic you are working with.

Together with your group, you will figure out how to publish a bookdown site through GitHub. Only one site needs to be published for each research team.

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following questions:

  1. What is the link to your group's GitHub site?
  
  2. What resources did you read this week? For full credit, you must provide a summary of at least two articles.
  
  3. What questions, if any, do you have?
  
  4. What are you planning to accomplish next week?
  
#### Week of October 24 (Week 10)

This week, you will finish your individual research, reading about the specific topic for your final project. Remember that you should focus on finding resources that help you understand the methodological topic you are working with.

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following questions:

  1. Provide a summary of each article or source in your individual literature review. Include proper citation of the article for your bibliography. You must include summaries of at least 5 resources for full credit.
  
  2. What questions, if any, do you have?
  
You will receive feedback on your submitted literature review before next week's first class meeting.

#### Week of October 31 (Week 11)

This week, your team will come together to first, construct the draft of the literature review, and second, select and describe the dataset to be used in your project. These will be drafted and published through bookdown on the research team's GitHub website. 

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following questions:

  1. What is the link to your team's website on GitHub?
  
  2. What questions do you have, if any?
  
  3. What did you contribute to the team's work this week?
  
  4. What are you planning to accomplish next week?
  
#### Week of November 7 (Week 12)

This week, your team will work on analyzing the data selected last week, with the goal of demonstrating how to analyze data with the selected methodological topic. You will draft both the methods and results sections. The methods section should include formal definitions of the models and methodology, but derivations are not necessary. The results section should provide model results as well as explanations for an audience that do not have expertise in the methodology you've been learning.

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following questions:

  1. What is the link to your team's website on GitHub?
  
  2. What questions do you have, if any?
  
  3. What did you contribute to the team's work this week?
  
  4. What are you planning to accomplish next week?
  
#### Week of November 14 (Week 13)

This week, your team will revise the draft based on feedback provided by instructors. You will create a final draft that, on Monday next week, will be distributed to other classmates for peer evaluation.

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following questions:

  1. What is the link to your team's website on GitHub?
  
  2. What questions do you have, if any?
  
  3. What did you contribute to the team's work this week?
  
  4. What are you planning to accomplish next week?

#### Week of November 21 (Week 14)

This week, your team will draft slides using R Markdown and prepare (practice) for next week's presentation. Each team member is expected to speak during the presentation. Your slides should be posted to your GitHub website. Peer reviews are due by Sunday evening.

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following questions:

  1. What is the link to your team's presentation on GitHub?
  
  2. What questions do you have, if any?
  
  3. What did you contribute to the team's work this week?

#### Week of November 28 (Week 15)

Peer reviews will be returned to the teams on Monday. Research teams should work to make edits based on peer review and prior instructor feedback and prepare for their presentations. 

By Sunday, you will complete a "quiz" on Canvas with the following questions:

  1. What is the link to your team's presentation on GitHub?
  
  2. What did you learn from the presentations this week?

#### Week of December 5 (Week 16) 

Papers should be complete with the final version published by the end of the day on Wednesday, December 7. You will complete a "quiz" with the following questions:

  1. What is the link to your team's website on GitHub?
  
  2. Upload a .zip file of the documents required to knit your bookdown together.
